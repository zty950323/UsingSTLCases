# UsingSTLEx

1. This project is mainly used to learn how to use STL. I will write some simple functions to realize some simple functions.
2. A series of STL types will be used in this project, and there will be corresponding sample code.
3. Each sample code will be divided into a separate file with corresponding comments.


## Compile necessary

1. There must be cmake, you can go to [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) Download the latest version from the official website.
2. It is recommended to install visual studio on Windows platform. It doesn't matter if the version is 2010. You can go to [visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) for detailsYou can download it inside.


## Overview

After having the above environment foundation, you can start compiling this project to use some of the code I learned from STL, mainly some simple examples. The code of my project is not complex, but the use of STL is very pure. I won't bring in some coding habits and some basic files, Is to write the code to learn STL with a beginner's attitude.

This project is mainly an experimental project for learning and using some concepts in STL. For convenience, a simple cmake system is established to facilitate management and use. The specific steps of generating the project are as follows:

1. First, create a build directory under your own directory;
2. On the command line, 'cd build';
3. You can directly 'cmake..'. Note that in this case, you must put the build in the project folder, or you need to find the location of cmakelists.txt yourself;
4. Open the generated SLN, compile it, and run each example project by yourself.
